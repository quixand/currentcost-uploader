This is a perl script that runs in the background, collects data from the currentcost ENVI home powermeter via its serial port and uploads to google powermeter.

The script can be used by a run level manager i.e. init.d to execute on startup.

currently only tested on debian and osx snow leopard.
Developed on Snow leopard, but probably works fine on anything that can run perl 5.10.
